# Simulation of Oligopoly Market Policies in the Cement Industry

This repository contains the simulation codes used to analyze the impact of various market policies on the cement industry, including **Excess Capacity as Entry Barriers** and **Price Control Policies**. The simulations are based on the model developed by Basiri et al. (2024), adapted to reflect the unique characteristics of Indonesia's cement market.

## Introduction

The simulation models oligopolistic competition in the Indonesian cement market by analyzing the behavior of price-taking and price-making firms under different policy scenarios. The results provide insights into firm profitability, market dynamics, and the effectiveness of these policies.

This repository includes Python code for simulating:
1. Firm behavior and profitability dynamics.
2. The impact of policy interventions on market outcomes.

The results contribute to the discussion of policy effectiveness, including economic and regulatory considerations.
